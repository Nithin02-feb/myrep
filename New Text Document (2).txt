Git for Windows v2.23.0 Release Notes
Latest update: August 17th 2019

Introduction
These release notes describe issues specific to the Git for Windows release. The release notes covering the history of the core git commands can be found in the Git project.

See http://git-scm.com/ for further details about Git including ports to other operating systems. Git for Windows is hosted at https://gitforwindows.org/.

Known issues
On Windows 10 before 1703, or when Developer Mode is turned off, special permissions are required when cloning repositories with symbolic links, therefore support for symbolic links is disabled by default. Use git clone -c core.symlinks=true <URL> to enable it, see details here.
If configured to use Plink, you will have to connect with putty first and accept the host key.
Some console programs, most notably non-MSYS2 Python, PHP, Node and OpenSSL, interact correctly with MinTTY only when called through winpty (e.g. the Python console needs to be started as winpty python instead of just python).
cURL uses $HOME/_netrc instead of $HOME/.netrc.
If you specify command-line options starting with a slash, POSIX-to-Windows path conversion will kick in converting e.g. "/usr/bin/bash.exe" to "C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\bash.exe". When that is not desired -- e.g. "--upload-pack=/opt/git/bin/git-upload-pack" or "-L/regex/" -- you need to set the environment variable MSYS_NO_PATHCONV temporarily, like so:

MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 git blame -L/pathconv/ msys2_path_conv.cc

Alternatively, you can double the first slash to avoid POSIX-to-Windows path conversion, e.g. "//usr/bin/bash.exe".

Windows drives are normally recognised within the POSIX path as /c/path/to/dir/ where /c/ (or appropriate drive letter) is equivalent to the C:\ Windows prefix to the \path\to\dir. If this is not recognised, revert to the C:\path\to\dir Windows style.
Git for Windows will not allow commits containing DOS-style truncated 8.3-format filenames ending with a tilde and digit, such as mydocu~1.txt. A workaround is to call git config core.protectNTFS false, which is not advised. Instead, add a rule to .gitignore to ignore the file(s), or rename the file(s).
Many Windows programs (including the Windows Explorer) have problems with directory trees nested so deeply that the absolute path is longer than 260 characters. Therefore, Git for Windows refuses to check out such files by default. You can overrule this default by setting core.longPaths, e.g. git clone -c core.longPaths=true ....
Some commands are not yet supported on Windows and excluded from the installation.
As Git for Windows is shipped without Python support, git p4 (which is backed by a Python script) is not supported.
The Quick Launch icon will only be installed for the user running setup (typically the Administrator). This is a technical restriction and will not change.
Older versions of the Windows Explorer do not calculate Git for Windows' on-disk size correctly, as it is unaware of hard links. Therefore, it might look like Git for Windows takes up 1.5GB when in reality it is about a third of that.
Should you encounter other problems, please first search the bug tracker (also look at the closed issues) and the mailing list, chances are that the problem was reported already. Also make sure that you use an up to date Git for Windows version (or a current snapshot build). If it has not been reported, please follow our bug reporting guidelines and report the bug.

Bug Fixes
Git for Windows' MSYS2 runtime was patched to fix a bug where setting the environment variable SHELL to an empty string in a shell script would not only fail to pass that setting to non-MSYS2 processes (such as git.exe) but also completely skip all environment variables that sort after said variable.
git clean -dfx no longer follows NTFS junction points (also known as mount points).
A workaround now allows cloning to certain network drives (e.g. Isilon).
Fixed CVE-2019-1211 in MinGit/Portable Git by being more careful about validating the Windows-wide config.

A bug which on occasion caused lengthy rebase runs to crash without error message was fixed.
Two workarounds from the Git for Windows 1.x era (concerning reading credentials via GUI and fetching via git://) were considered obsolete.
git difftool --no-index can now be run outside of Git worktrees.
git rebase -i used to get confused when an exec command created new commits and then appended pick lines for them. This has been fixed.
During a run of git rebase --rebase-merges, the output of git status now shows label lines correctly, i.e. with the labels' names instead of the commit hash they point to.

Aliases that expand to shell commands can now take arguments containing curly brackets.
Ctrl+C is now handled in Git Bash in a sophisticated way: it emulates the way Ctrl+C is handled in Git CMD, but in a fine-grained way.
Based on the the new Ctrl+C handling in Git Bash, pressing Ctrl+C while git log is running will only stop Git from traversing the commit history, but keep the pager running.

New Features
Comes with Git v2.16.3.
When choosing to "Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt" (i.e. add only the minimal set of Git executables to the PATH), and when choosing the Git LFS component, Git LFS is now included in that minimal set. This makes it possible to reuse Git for Windows' Git LFS, say, from Visual Studio.

The tar utility (included as a courtesy, not because Git needs it) can now unpack .tar.xz archives.
Bug Fixes
When a TERM is configured that Git for Windows does not know about, Bash no longer crashes.
The regression where gawk stopped treating Carriage Returns as part of the line endings was fixed.
When Git asks for credentials via the terminal in a Powershell window, it no longer fails to do so.
The installer is now more robust when encountering files that are in use (and can therefore not be overwritten right away).
The included find and rm utilities no longer have problems with deeply nested directories on FAT drives.
The cygpath utility included in Git for Windows now strips trailing slashes when normalizing paths (just like the Cygwin version of the utility; this is different from how MSYS2 chooses to do things).
The certificates of HTTPS proxies configured via http.proxy are now validated against the ca-bundle.crt correctly.
Changes since Git for Windows v2.16.1(4) (February 7th 2018)
New Features
Comes with Git v2.16.2.
For every new Git for Windows version, .zip archives containing .pdb files for some of Git for Windows' components are now published alongside the new version.

Bug Fixes
The Perl upgrade in Git for Windows v2.16.1(4) broke interactive authentication of git svn, which was fixed.
When configuring HTTPS transport to use Secure Channel, we now refrain from configuring http.sslCAInfo. This also helps Git LFS (which uses Git for Windows' private http.sslCAInfo setting) to use the same credentials as git fetch and git push.
Changes since Git for Windows v2.16.1(3) (February 6th 2018)
Bug Fixes
When called from TortoiseGit, git.exe can now spawn processes again.
Changes since Git for Windows v2.16.1(2) (February 2nd 2018)
New Features
Git for Windows' SDK packages are now hosted on Azure Blobs, fixing part of issue #1479.
Comes with perl-Net-SSLeay v1.84.
Bug Fixes
When http.sslBackend is not configured (e.g. in portable Git or MinGit), fetch/push operations no longer crash.
On Windows 7 and older, Git for Windows v2.16.1(2) was no longer able to spawn any processes (e.g. during fetch/clone). This regression has been fixed.
The Perl upgrade in v2.16.1(2) broke git send-email; This has been fixed by updating the Net-SSLeay Perl module.

When using Secure Channel as HTTPS transport behind a proxy, it may be necessary to disable revocation checks, which is now possible.
Comes with BusyBox v1.28.0pre.16550.0b3cdd76c.
Bug Fixes
When Git spawns processes, now only the necessary file handles are inherited from the parent process, possibly preventing file locking issues.
The git update command has been renamed to git update-git-for-windows to avoid confusion where users may think that git update updates their local repository or worktree.
Changes since Git for Windows v2.16.0(2) (January 18th 2018)
This is a hotfix release, based on upstream Git's hotfix to address a possible segmentation fault associated with case-insensitive file systems.

Note: another hotfix might be coming the day after tomorrow, as cURL announced a new version addressing security advisories that might affect how Git talks via HTTP/HTTPS, too.

New Features
Comes with Git v2.16.1.
Bug Fixes
A set of regressions introduced by patches intended to speed up reset and checkout was fixed (issues #1437, #1438, #1440 and #1442).
Changes since Git for Windows v2.15.1(2) (November 30th 2017)

On Windows, UNC paths can now be accessed via file://host/share/repo.git-style paths.
Comes with a new custom Git command git update to help keeping Git up-to-date on your machine.
The Git installer now offers an option to keep Git up-to-date by calling git update regularly.
Comes with BusyBox v1.28.0pre.16353.2739df917.
As is common elsewhere, Ctrl+Left and Ctrl+Right now move word-wise in Git Bash, too.

The experimental option --show-ignored-directory was added to git status to show only the name of ignored directories when the option --untracked=all is used.
Git for Windows releases now also include an experimental BusyBox-based MinGit.
Bug Fixes
Repository-local aliases are now resolved again in worktrees.

New Features

Thanks to Johan 't Hart, files and directories starting with a single dot (such as .git) will now be marked hidden (you can disable this setting with core.hideDotFiles=false in your config) (Issue 288).
Thanks to Thorvald Natvig, Git on Windows can simulate symbolic links by using reparse points when available. For technical reasons, this only works for symbolic links pointing to files, not directories.
A lot of work has been put into making it possible to compile Git's source code (the part written in C, of course, not the scripts) with Microsoft Visual Studio. This work is ongoing.

Bugfixes
Plink errors out rather than hanging when the user needs to accept a host key first (Issue 96).

The environment setting $CYGWIN=tty is ignored (Issues 138, 248 and 251).
The ls command shows non-ASCII filenames correctly now (Issue 188).
Adds more syntax files for vi (Issue 250).

In some setups, hard-linking is not as reliable as it should be, so we have a workaround which avoids hard links in some situations (Issues 222 and 229).

Bugfixes
Renaming was made more robust (due to Explorer or some virus scanners, files could not be renamed at the first try, so we have to try multiple times).
Johannes Sixt made lots of changes to the test-suite to identify properly which tests should pass, and which ones cannot pass due to limitations of the platform.
Support PAGERs with spaces in their filename.
Quite a few changes were undone which we needed in the olden days of msysGit.
Fall back to / when HOME cannot be set to the real home directory due to locale issues (works around Issue 108 for the moment).

Git correctly passes port numbers to PuTTY's Plink
Changes since Git-1.5.4-preview20080202
New Features
Comes with official git 1.5.5.
core.autocrlf is enabled (true) by default. This means git converts to Windows line endings (CRLF) during checkout and converts to Unix line endings (LF) during commit. This is the right choice for cross-platform projects. If the conversion is not reversible, git warns the user. The installer warns about the new default before the installation starts.
The user does no longer have to "accept" the GPL but only needs to press "continue".
Installer deletes shell scripts that have been replaced by builtins. Upgrading should be safer.
Supports git svn. Note that the performance might be below your expectation.
Bugfixes
Newer ssh fixes connection failures (issue 74).

New Features
Git is included in version 1.5.3.6.
Setup displays release notes.
Bugfixes
pull/fetch/push in git-gui works. Note, there is no way for ssh to ask for a passphrase or for confirmation if you connect to an unknown host. So, you must have ssh set up to work without passphrase. Either you have a key without passphrase, or you started ssh-agent. You may also consider using PuTTY by pointing GIT_SSH to plink.exe and handle your ssh keys with Pageant. In this case you should include your login name in urls. You must also connect to an unknown host once from the command line and confirm the host key, before you can use it from git-gui.
